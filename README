Welcome to Dynamic URL Music Generation 
( Proof of Concept Ramaze Music App )

The Goal of this Application is to generate Music Dynamical Both through a Simple form or Simple Restful URL changes

Basic Layout Idea for restful Music Generation 

play = will generate a Musical score based off the users form input
it requires 3 Arguments after the play  
1st => number of notes you want generated 
2nd => set of number is Tempo 
3rd => is the scale you want the composition based around 
 
Example url would look like => http://localhost:7000/play/32/120/major

Resent Changes include

Added require midilib Gem to the app.rb file 
Finished Designing rough basic forms layout 
created a lib folder for storing scale.rb and chord.rb for dynamic pulling of info 

Features In progress 

Building a Dynamic Scale System 
Building A Dynamic Chord System 

concept for scale drop down when the a scale is selected from the dropdown it grabbed from the scales.rb file 
and then the form generates a midi composition randomly grabbing the notes within the selected scale. 

Code that works out side of Ramaze app looks like this 

require 'scale'

def scale_song
 s=[ ]
 32.times {|n| s << lydian_min[rand(lydian_min.size)] }
 s.to_midi("scale_song1.mid")
end
