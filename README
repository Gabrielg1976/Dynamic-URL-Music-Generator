Welcome to Dynamic URL Music Generation 
( Proof of Concept Ramaze Music App )

The Goal of this Application is to generate Music Dynamical Both through a Simple form or Simple Restful URL changes

Basic Layout Idea for restful Music Generation 

play = will generate a Musical score based off the users form input
it requires 3 Arguments after the play  
1st => number of notes you want generated 
2nd => set of number is Tempo 
3rd => is the scale you want the composition based around 
 
Example url would look like => http://localhost:7000/play/32/120/major

Resent Changes include

Got the tester form to change the url dynamically
 
added a MDA file that might be the foundation of all the other music library such as 
the scales and chord libraries.

added to the /lib/audio_system.rb
added the /lib/scale.rb controls the scales structure
added the the /lib/chords.rb controls the chord structure ( calls on the scales.rb file )

Added require midilib Gem to the app.rb file 
Finished Designing rough basic forms layout 
created a lib folder for storing scale.rb and chord.rb for dynamic pulling of info 

The Engine to this system for converting different data types into music 
is also found currently in the lib folder called super_midi.rb  


Features In progress 

Built A Dynamic Scale System 
Built A Dynamic Chord System 

Concept for scale drop down when the a scale is selected from the dropdown it grabbed from the scales.rb file 
and then the form generates a midi composition randomly grabbing the notes within the selected scale. 








:::Custom Flash Sampler Application specs:::

1. This needs to have a preset Audio sample like piano on shoots 
that can be mapped over keyboard interface..( future version will allow user to upload there own sample and map them across the musical Range )

2. The samples will be triggered via midi that is streamed in through the use of API URL.

the examples of how the url works is this 

http://localhost:7000/64/120/major 

64 = the number of notes
120 is the tempo of the track 
major = will be called from a scale library

Url will be feed into the flash player through a simple input box.
so the user will type in the url and the sounds will triggered.

The user will be allowed to change the samples dynamical while the music is playing and will change on the fly..
      
Mapping Function needed for mapping over the virtual keyboard 
saying you can have a piano sample playing over the first 4 octaves and a violin mapped over the last 4 octaves.
